This is one of the games that I made for a client. The request was to create a 2d endless runner + Covid19-quiz style game.

# Features

- You can jump or duck to avoid the viruses
- There's a highscore system.
- 3 levels in total. The goal is to reach the hospital.
- On the way to the hospital you are required to collect virus prevention items such as the face mask, hand sanitizer and a med-kit. Everytime you collect an item, you are prompted to answer a question on COVID-19. 
- At the end, you're completion time and total quiz scores  will be shown.
